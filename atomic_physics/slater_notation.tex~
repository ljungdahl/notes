\subsection{Some new notation to generalise}
We can generalise the previous results for a two-electron system to $N$-electrons, and to aid in doing this we introduce new notation. We let Greek letters label ordered sets of quantum numbers representing Slater determinants. If $\alpha$ represents $a,b,c,\dots,n$ we write the determinantal state as\footnote{LM then claims that we should call \emph{single-particle functions}, that appear in the determinant, for \emph{occupied} orbitals, and the ``remaining set'' for \emph{excited/virtual} orbitals. But what does this mean? Isn't every factor function $\phi_x(i), x \in abc\dots n$ only a single particle function? The answer to this is that it is poor language in LM. The ``remaining set'' refers not to the set $abc,\dots,n$, but to all possible states in the atom (or continuum I guess). Every orbital that is put in a slater determinant is supposed to be a single electron function.}\eqa{alpha111}{
  \ket{\alpha} = \ket{\slater{abc,\dots,n}}.
  }
\indent We proceed and say that $\ket{\alpha_a^r}$ denotes a determinant state in wich an occupied orbital $a$ in $\alpha$ is replaced by an excited orbital $r$. We also have double substition (excitation?) written as $\ket{\alpha_{ab}^{rs}}$ and so on.
