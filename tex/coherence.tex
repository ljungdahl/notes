 \section{Coherence}
 From wiki:\\
 Two wave sources are coherent if they have the same frequency $\nu$ and waveform and \emph{constant} phase difference
 $\delta$. We can always choose initial time such that one of the waves have a zero phase at $t=0$.
 So if two wavefunctions $f_\nu(x, t)$ and $g_\nu(x,t)$ are coherent according to the above definition, and $f_\nu(x,t)$
 has a zero phase at $t=0$, we have that for all $x$ and $t$
\eqsa{coh1}{
f_\nu(x,t)-g_\nu(x,t) = \delta,
}
 since they have the same waveform and differ only by a constant phase.
